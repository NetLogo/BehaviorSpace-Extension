# BehaviorSpace Extension for NetLogo

The BehaviorSpace extension allows you to create and run BehaviorSpace experiments from NetLogo code. You can use the
extension alone or in combination with the GUI BehaviorSpace tool, and you can run experiments created in the GUI tool
with the extension.

## Using the BehaviorSpace Extension

To use the BehaviorSpace extension in a model, include the following line at the top of your code:

```
extensions [bspace]
```

If you are already using another extension, you can just add `bspace` to the list inside the square brackets.

Once the extension is loaded, you can use it to run experiments from anywhere in the code. Note that experiments
created in the code will persist for the duration of the current NetLogo session if not cleared with the
`bspace:clear-experiments` command (see [`bspace:clear-experiments`](#bspaceclear-experiments)).

Experiments created in the code will have the following default values:

Pre Experiment Commands: empty
Setup Commands: empty
Go Commands: empty
Post Run Commands: empty
Post Experiment Commands: empty
Repetitions: 1
Sequential Run Order: true
Run Metrics Every Step: true
Run Metrics Condition: empty
Time Limit: 0
Stop Condition: empty
Metrics: empty
Variables: empty
Threads: determined by number of processor cores
Recommended Max Threads: determined by number of processor cores
Table: empty
Spreadsheet: empty
Stats: empty
Lists: empty
Update View: true
Update Plots And Monitors: true
Mirror Headless Output: false

Any properties can also be set explicitly to other default values. For code blocks, you can specify "do nothing" with
an empty pair of square brackets.
